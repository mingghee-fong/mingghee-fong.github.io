        CSS Box Model

      <h2>
        Let's Talk About
        <em>CSS Box Model !</em>
        <br />
        <br />What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?
      </h2>
      <h3>Before we start, we shall identify:</h3>

      <p>
        -Margin = Plain wall, where you hang your painting.
        <br />
        -Border = Painting Frame also known as the Box, where you frame up your
        painting.
        <br />
        -Padding = Mount border/matte, a space between the picture and the
        frame.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>Scenario for Margin:</h3>

      <p>
        Let say, you've just moved in to your new house. In your living room,
        there is a plain wall where you want to hang your painting. By default,
        your painting would sit on the top left of the wall.
        <br />
        So, how do you determine where your painting goes on the wall?
        <br />
        You will be using "margin: ;" to add space outside of your box/painting.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        <span><strong>FOR EXAMPLES:</strong></span>
        <br />"margin: 50px;" would add a space of 50px all around the box.
        <br />*Note: margin 50px or represents clockwise manner of margin:
        50px(top) 50px(right) 50px(bottom) 50px(left); If your box/painting
        appears on the top left of the wall, you will see that the box/painting
        moves slightly downwards and to the right but nothing happens to the
        right or bottom. This is because the code that we have just written
        creates an invisible 50px barrier all around the object.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The other method that you can apply is using the code below:
        <br />
        margin-top: 50px;
        <br />margin-right: 50px; <br />margin-bottom: 50px; <br />margin-left:
        50px;
        <br />
        <br />This will give the same function as what was given above. However,
        you can manipulate on each of the code by changing the px value to
        determine where you want your painting to appear on the wall.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        What if I have two paintings sitting next to each other and using of
        margin: 50px; on each of them?
        <br />
        With this case, the two paintings will have a 50px space on the left of
        painting 1, 100px space in between painting 1 & 2 and 50px on the right
        of painting 2.
        <br />
        <br />
        What if I want to have only 50px between them?
        <br />
        Well, you can do it by setting the right margin of first painting to
        50px and the left margin of second painting to 0px OR by setting the
        right margin of the first painting to 0px and the left margin of second
        painting to 50px.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>Scenario for Border:</h3>

      <p>
        Hmmm. Border, border, border...
        <br />
        Alright, think of it as the frame of your photograph, painting or
        picture. It is the barrier/wall in between margin and padding. It comes
        in different size, style and colour right?
        <br />
        All to achieve a better visual appearance. For border style, there are
        various CSS properties that you can use.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <span><strong>FOR EXAMPLES:</strong></span>
        <br />
        1. border-width : It determine the thickness of your border/frame.
        <br />
        2. border-style : Specifies the style of the border/frame. (e.g, solid,
        dashed or dotted)
        <br />
        3. border-colour : You can change the colour of your border.
        <br />
        4. border-radius : Rounding up the pointy corners of your box/frame.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Well, the same clockwise pattern applies to the value rules for 1, 2 and
        3.
        <br />
        However, with radius is a bit different. Because of the pointy corners
        do not lie exactly at top, right, bottom and left position, they have a
        different specification.
        <br />
        <br />
        What does that means?
        <br />
        Clockwise rule for radius properties start from the top-left corner,
        top-right corner, bottom-right corner and lastly bottom-left corner.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        So if you are to use "border-radius: 10px 20px 30px 40px;", it means:
        <br />border-top-left-radius: 10px, <br />border-top-right-radius: 20px,
        <br />border-bottom-right-radius: 30px, <br />border-bottom-left-radius:
        40px,
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>Scenario for Padding:</h3>

      <p>
        Lastly, paddding.
        <br />
        <br />We have talked about margin which is the spacing element that is
        happening OUTSIDE the frame. <br />Padding is similar to margin,
        however, it is the spacing element that is happening INSIDE the frame.
        <br />Now, we are talking about the actual content of the painting. To
        make it more appealing to the eyes, often we will see artist make a
        mount border/matte in between the frame and the content. <br />In this
        case, it is padding for CSS.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <span><strong>FOR EXAMPLES:</strong></span>
        <br />That's right, the clockwise rule AGAIN! <br />"padding: 50px;"
        represents "padding: 50x 50px 50px 50px;".
        <br />
        <br />Which is also, <br />padding-top: 50px; <br />padding-right: 50px;
        <br />padding-bottom: 50px; <br />padding-left: 50px;
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        What do they do? Yup, you know it.
        <br />
        <br />Creating a 50px spacing in between the frame and the content.
        <br />You can change the value accordingly and your content will shift
        around inside the frame or your border. <br />The shape changes too.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
