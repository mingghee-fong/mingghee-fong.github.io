      <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals</h1>
      <h2>
        Let's Talk About
        <em>JavaScript!</em>
      </h2>
      <h3>A Relationship Between JavaScript With HTML & CSS.</h3>

      <p>
        When we are building a house, there are 3 stages that we are
        considering.
        <br />1. The plan, foundation and structure. <br />2. The exterior and
        interior styling. <br />3. The features.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >How does building a house related to HTML, CSS and JavaScript?
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />1. HTML plays the role of a builder. <br />It constructs the
        foundation and structure of the house. <br />Much like when you are
        building a website, the very first thing you need to build is the basic
        content that appears on your webpage.
        <br />
        <br />2. CSS plays the role of a designer. <br />After your house is
        built, it's time to decide how you want your house to look on the
        outside and interior to suit your taste. Similarly, after you have built
        your HTML contents, you can use CSS to decorate your contents. For
        examples: you can change the style of your Fonts, decide your background
        colour and etc.
        <br />
        <br />3. JavaScript on the other hand, is the feature of your house.
        <br />You have settled with the structure of your house, you've designed
        how you want your house to look like and finally it's time to decide the
        feature which will make your house into a home. <br />Think about
        JavaScript as furnitures and appliances. These are the features that are
        interactable, making your home more lively and interactive. <br />In
        short, JavaScript adds function to your webpage for user to interactive
        with.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Control Flow & Loops</h3>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Let's think about making a jam & toast. Such a simple idea but it
          still has a sequence of events before getting that perfect toast.
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />Getting Bread (Control Flow): <br />The control flow starts with
        the first step of making toast, which is getting a slice of bread.
        <br />
        <br />Toaster Settings (Conditional Statements): <br />Next, you need to
        set the toaster to the desired level of toasting, which introduces a
        conditional decision. You adjust the toaster's settings based on your
        preference: light, medium, or dark toast.
        <br />
        <br />Toasting (Loop Statements): <br />As you put the bread in the
        toaster and press the lever, a loop begins. The toaster repeatedly heats
        the bread until it reaches the selected level of toasting. This looping
        process ensures the bread is toasted evenly.
        <br />
        <br />Checking (Conditional Statements): <br />Once the toaster
        finishes, you check the toast to see if it meets your desired level of
        toasting. If it's perfect, you proceed to the next step. If not, you
        might put it back in the toaster for a bit longer.
        <br />
        <br />Butter and Jam (Control Flow): <br />If the toast is to your
        liking, you continue with the control flow. You follow the sequence of
        adding butter and jam (or any toppings you prefer) to the toast.
        <br />
        <br />Eating (End of Control Flow): <br />Finally, you sit down and
        enjoy your toast, which marks the end of the control flow for this task.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong
          >In short, control flow is like a linear story telling. Control flow
          is the flow of the story, conditional is when you have to make a
          certain decision, loops is after you made decision then loop will
          bring you to the path you have chosen and eventually leading you to
          the end of the flow.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>What Is A Document Object Model(DOM) & How To Interact With It?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Document Object Model(DOM) provides an interface for JavaScript to
          interact with HTML.</strong
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        How so? Okay, DOM existence is purely for convenience.
        <br />After HTML structure and contents were built, going to back to the
        HTML to update in the future will be a pain as the content will grow
        bigger and bigger overtime. <br />Therefore, DOM is served as an
        interface/middleman for JavaScript to update and provide features at a
        later time. <br />It is faster and easier to use JavaScript to locate
        files and elements using codes and through DOM.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Differences Between Arrays and Objects & How To Access Them.</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>What is Arrays?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        -Array is like a organized list of items that has a particular order.
        <br />
        -For example in my kitchen, I have a shelf full of seasoning and spices
        in containers.
        <br />
        -They are sorted by alphabetical order from left to right and that
        determines their location and we can easily count their indices.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>How do we access data from Arrays?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        -So i've mentioned something about "index" in the definition earlier.
        <br />-Normally, as a human when we are counting something, we would
        start from 1,2,3 first second third. <br />-But in JavaScript and some
        of the other programming languages, they would start counting from 0,
        then 1 2 3 and so on.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong
          >For example, if we want to pick up the 3rd container from the shelf,
          we would use this syntax from below:</strong
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        let myContainer = ['almond','cumin','fennel','pepper'];
        <br />
        <br />
        console.log(myContainer[2]),
        <br />
        <br />Which will access the 3rd element in the array/shelf.
        <br />Meaning we will get "fennel as our result. <br />Remember that the
        index starts from 0.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>What is Objects?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Object can be a jar labelled with let say, candy filled in it, it can
        also have quanity and expiry date as the values. It can be placed
        anywhere randomly in the cupboard. Unlike array, we will access object
        by its label/name.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>How do we access data from Objects?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Accessing data from Object is like, going to the cupboard and look for
        the label.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong
          >For example, I have an onject/candy named "candyCherry". This cherry
          flavoured candy has about 31 pieces left in the jar and will be
          expiring on Janruary 2024. We want to look for the candy and also
          access the info in it,</strong
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        let candyCherry = {
        <br />flavour: "cherry" <br />quantity: 31, <br />expiryDate: "Jan2024"
        <br />}
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong
          >We will access it by using the code below, which will show us the
          entire values contained inside the object "candyCherry".</strong
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        console.log(candyCherry);
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong
          >To be more specific, we want to get the "quantity" data, we can use
          Dot Notation,</strong
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        console.log(candyCherry.quantity);
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>and we get 31 in return!</strong>
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>What Is Function & Why They Are Helpful?</h3>
      <p>
        Function is basically like a Thermomix, a powerful kitchen appliance
        used commercially in kitchens and also domestical household kitchens.
        <br />It is so versatile that it can perform various cooking tasks. From
        prepping vegetables to cooking them. All you need to do is just using
        the correct recipe and methods then it can execute result you wanted.
