      <h3>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </h3>

      <p>
        1. I've learnt to seek help from others, do not be stubborn insisting on
        being a one man show.
        <br />
        2. I've also learnt to go outside take a small break if necessary, come
        back with a fresh mind.
        <br />
        3. Learnt to accept the fact that it is okay to not know everything and
        be positive about it.
        <br />
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Values:</strong>
        <br />
        Your values determine on the decision that you make, whether it's
        ethical or unethical. Sometimes, convenience can be handy but does it
        actually provide positive impact or negative impact top humanity?
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Empathy:</strong>
        <br />
        Empathy help us Humans to understand each other emotionally, which comes
        to a better communication and better collaboration.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Self-awareness:</strong>
        <br />
        Having self-awareness helps us to understand and accept our own flaws.
        No one is perfect, everyday we learn to discover our imperfection and
        make improvement. At the end of the day, you are just a better version
        of the you from yesterday, the you from tomorrow will never be a perfect
        you.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        Core learning may seem unnecessary, however, as Humans everyday and
        every moment is a core learning process. We contained emotions, what we
        see, what we hear, will have a certain impact to what you think and how
        you act. Learning how to tackle all these information and turning them
        into a positive energy will lead to a better future for humanity.
        Because the nature of it is something that is happening every second, it
        is hard for us to notice the importance of it. When I found out Dev
        Academy is strongly emphasizing on this skill, I was surprised and it
        came to senses that if I constantly practice core skill, I will be more
        aware of improving from within.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        I think the most challenging part is probably changing my mindset. There
        are so many factors that can affect the process, for examples, my
        personality and environments. Core learning has got no set answer to a
        solution, it is like a water that can take in various shape. But at the
        same time, water can be easily polluted as well.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h3>
      <p>
        You can have all the technical knowledge in the world but without having
        comrades, you are nothing. Human skill will be a critical skill to
        thrive in a collaborative environment. At the end of the day, teamwork
        is always two better than one.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I certainly don't think that it's a waste of time. I think the balance
        of learning core skill and tech skill is perfect. It is a reminder for
        that i am not a robot.
