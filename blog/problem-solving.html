      <h1>Problem Solving Technical Blog</h1>

      <h3>1. Time when I was blocked on a simple problem:</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>What was the problem?</strong>
        <br />
        -Choosing a method to solve a question. It's like you are going out for
        dinner, but you can't decide what attire to wear. Essentially they all
        served the purpose of not going out naked but the thing is, which one is
        more suitable.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>What problem-solving techniques did I use?</strong>
        <br />
        -I went with having multiple choices, wrote the code out then commented
        out all of them except for one and repeat the process. Then I will pick
        the one that I will understand the most. Much like, you have all your
        outfit ready but you are thinking what sort of occasion it is that you
        are attending and whichever you feel more appeal to your mood that day,
        you pick that one.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>How did I feel throughout the process?</strong>
        <br />
        -Exhausted and beaten. I was literally staring at the screen and at the
        same questions for hours.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>What did I learn?</strong>
        <br />
        -Don't waste time, don't be stubborn. Ask for help if I am really
        struggling.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>2. Time when I elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>What was the problem?</strong>
        <br />
        -This is from Kata, Built-in Methods. Majority of the questions, I
        struggled a lot. But it's probably because it has been weeks since i
        started coding so i probably grew a little more like a programmer. As
        soon I saw this question asking me to make each of the words of a
        sentence in to Capital letters, it clicked.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>What problem-solving techniques did I use?</strong>
        <br />
        -Pseudocode and Googling for methods.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>How did I feel throughout the process?</strong>
        <br />
        -It made me gain confident, A LOT!
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>What did I learn?</strong>
        <br />
        -Gotta keep trying, in programming there is tons of solutions, so don't
        be discourage.
        <br />
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        3. Reflection on how confident I feel using each of these
        problem-solving techniques/processes:
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>On a scale from 1 to 10:</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Pseudocode --- <em>6/10</em><br />
        Trying something --- <em>7/10</em><br />
        Rubber ducky method --- <em>2/10</em><br />
        Reading error messages --- <em>3/10</em><br />
        Console.logging --- <em>8/10</em><br />
        Googling --- <em>8.5/10</em><br />
        Asking your peers for help --- <em>4/10</em><br />
        Asking coaches for help --- <em>3/10</em><br />
        Improving your process with reflection --- <em>3/10</em><br />
        <br />
        Score given above is my current status.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
        made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        -Composing a good question is hard, that is what holding me back from
        asking questions. Regardless of good and bad, i think i need to learn to
        ask if i get stuck.
