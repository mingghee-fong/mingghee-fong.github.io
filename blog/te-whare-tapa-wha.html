      <h3>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing) :</h3>
      <p>
        Every week I'd aim to go for at least 2 badminton sessions on the
        weekend. Usually about 2 to 3 hours each session. Badminton involves a
        lot of quick decision making in order to win a point, so at the same
        time it trains my brain too.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing) :</h3>
      <p>
        Well, I have no family in New Zealand but I do have a few close friends.
        I don't usually go hangout with them, only once in a while. But when we
        do, it's a lot of fun and good quality time together. They totally
        understand that my social battery runs out quick.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing) :</h3>
      <p>
        I personally prefers A LOT of me-time. When I say a lot, it's like even
        my housemate will not be able to see me for more than 48 hours even
        though I am at home. I love the tranquil and quietness, having my
        Youtube music on "Natural Rainforest Sound" which kinda creates that
        soothing environment to relax my mind.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing) :</h3>
      <p>
        I personally do not deny the existence of God. I am a buddhist, more
        precisely, I came from a buddhist family. But I personally don't
        practice it, I believed in only my personal hardwork as to survive in
        the real world. But I respect all kind of religion beliefs. It's more
        about keeping a good heart and having a kind soul.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment) :</h3>
      <p>
        This is propably the hardest for me. I like to spend time in something
        that will give results. Subconciously, I might feel like taking a walk
        or spending hours out on a walk is taxing too much on my time to be
        productive. I treat that as a reward when the tasks on my hand are all
        cleared then I'd go out and take walks. However, I do enjoy the views of
        nature and like the peace that it has brought to me.
