        <em>Story That Made Me Who I am Today.</em>
      </h2>
      <h3>Ethical Decision:</h3>

      <p>
        This is when I was 18 years old, right after high school. My parents had
        sent me to university, but not long after I became very homesick and
        decided to quit after the first semester due to several panic attack *at
        the time I thought I was sick, only found out it was panic attack last
        year after seeing someone was suffering from it*. So I had no choice but
        to come back to my hometown.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unfortunately, I had missed the entry date for the local government
        pre-university. Unbeknownst to me, my mom went to the school to beg the
        principal for late admission. However, I didn't appreciate the effort
        she had put in, and I didn't study hard. As a result, I failed an
        important exam, and my mom cried, asking why I hadn't tried my best. At
        that moment, I realized I needed to take responsibility for my education
        and make a change. So, I decided to move out of my home and for myself
        to be more independent.
        <br />
        <br />
        After that event, I made a significant ethical decision related to my
        education by enrolling in a Culinary School to pursue my passion as a
        chef. This decision was influenced by the values of independence and
        hard work instilled in me by my family.
        <br />
        <br />
        Looking back, I realize the ethical dimension of my decision. It
        involved valuing my education and appreciating the sacrifices my parents
        were making for me. I weighed my desire for independence against my
        responsibility to make the most of the educational opportunities
        provided.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ultimately, I chose to take control of my education and my life. Now,
        reflecting on that decision, I am proud of myself for stepping out of my
        comfort zone, pushing my limits, and appreciating the importance of
        education and family support.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>Influence of Culture and People:</h3>

      <p>
        My values and identity have been significantly influenced by my family's
        culture and their life experiences. My parents had challenging
        upbringings, and they have always strived to provide my sister and me
        with the best opportunities.
        <br />
        <br />
        They emphasized the importance of independence, a value that became more
        apparent to me when I left home. Witnessing their resilience and
        determination in the face of adversity has shaped my values of hardwork,
        self-reliance, and empathy for others.
        <br />
        <br />
        My family's culture has taught me the value of perseverance and the
        importance of supporting one another.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>Strengths for My Learning Journey:</h3>

      <p>
        One of my strengths that will support me on my learning journey is the
        ability to approach matters in a non-biased manner. This means I can
        assess situations from multiple angles and viewpoints, which is crucial
        for problem-solving and decision-making.
        <br />
        <br />
        Additionally, I am comfortable working independently, which allows me to
        take initiative and be self-motivated in my learning and career
        development.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>Limitations and Their Impact:</h3>

      <p>
        However, I also recognize my limitations. I am not naturally inclined to
        be people-oriented, and I often struggle to seek help or collaborate
        effectively with others. This could be a potential obstacle on my
        learning journey, as learning often involves teamwork, communication,
        and seeking guidance from others. My introverted tendencies might hinder
        my ability to network and build relationships crucial for career
        development.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>Working with Others:</h3>

      <p>
        In the past, I have faced a situation where tension arose while working
        with others in the kitchen. Different opinions clashed, and there was
        resistance to finding a solution. To address this, we tried a strategy
        that involved putting egos aside and promoting open-minded
        communication.
        <br />
        <br />
        This approach, though challenging, was effective in diffusing tension
        and allowing us to collaborate more effectively. Reflecting on this
        experience, I realize that while this strategy worked to some extent,
        it's also essential to acknowledge and respect diverse perspectives from
        the beginning.
        <br />
        <br />
        In future situations, I would focus on fostering a more inclusive and
        collaborative environment from the start, encouraging everyone to
        contribute their ideas and actively seeking consensus to avoid
        unnecessary tension.
