      <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
      <h2>
        “Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone
        who keeps learning stays young. The greatest thing in life is to keep
        your mind young.”

        <em>— Henry Ford</em>
      </h2>
      <h3>Career Pathway & Long term Goal:</h3>

        is to be able to finish this Dev bootcamp and then land on a job as a
        junior developer or junior programmer.

      <h3>Commitment On Managing My Workload In This Programme:</h3>
      <p>
        <strong
          >How I Will Try To Manage Myself To Work Productively & Safely With
          Others:</strong
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>Effective Communication:</span>
        <br />I will actively work on improving my communication skills,
        especially in terms of active listening and expressing myself clearly
        and respectfully. This will help me collaborate more effectively with
        fellow learners, facilitators, and industry/community representatives.
        <br />
        <br /><span>Emotional Intelligence:</span> <br />I will continue to
        develop my emotional intelligence, particularly in managing my own
        emotions and understanding the emotions of others. This will help me
        build stronger relationships and resolve conflicts more constructively.
        <br />
        <br /><span>Adaptability:</span> <br />Building on my natural
        adaptability, I will remain open to different working styles and ideas
        from my peers and facilitators. I'll embrace change when necessary and
        demonstrate flexibility in group projects and tasks.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>Stress Management:</span>
        <br />Given my tendency to experience stress and frustration, I will
        proactively work on stress management techniques, such as mindfulness,
        time management, and seeking support when needed. This will ensure I can
        maintain emotional balance even during demanding periods.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >What I Will Do When Things Are Building Up & Starting to Get to
          Me:</strong
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>Recognize Early Warning Signs:</span>
        <br />I will pay attention to early signs of stress and overwhelm, such
        as changes in mood, decreased productivity, or physical symptoms.
        Self-awareness will be my first line of defense.
        <br />
        <br /><span>Time Management:</span> <br />I will refine my time
        management skills to ensure I allocate sufficient time for assignments,
        projects, and personal well-being. This proactive approach will help
        prevent last-minute rushes.
        <br />
        <br /><span>Reach Out for Support:</span> <br />When I feel that things
        are starting to get overwhelming, I will try not to hesitate when it
        comes to asking for support. This could include discussing my concerns
        with facilitators or fellow learners.
        <br />
        <br /><span>Adapt and Adjust:</span> <br />If necessary, I will be
        prepared to adjust my workload or priorities. This might involve
        reprioritizing assignments, or even taking a short break to recharge
        when needed.
        <br />
        <br /><span>Practice Self-Care:</span> <br />I will prioritize self-care
        routines, including regular exercise, healthy eating, and sufficient
        sleep. These practices will help me maintain physical and mental
        well-being, making it easier to handle stress.
        <br />
        <br /><span>Reflect and Learn:</span> <br />After challenging periods, I
        will take time to reflect on what caused the stress and how I can better
        manage similar situations in the future. Learning from these experiences
        will contribute to my personal growth.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Commintment On Seeking Help In a Timely Manner:</h3>
      <p>
        I am committed to seeking help promptly when needed during the program.
        I will stay self-aware, communicate clearly, build a support network,
        seek mentorship, use available resources, manage my time effectively,
        access counseling services when necessary, collaborate with peers, and
        learn from my experiences. This commitment ensures that I address
        challenges promptly and make the most of my learning journey.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Expectation From The Facilitation Team:</h3>
      <p>
        I think sometimes I will ask dumb questions or even when
        examples/explanations given to me, I may not get it still. I just hope
        the facilitation team will be patient with me because I will be
        frustrated with myself for not understand it too. Sigh.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Scheduling Information:</h3>
      <p>I am fully dedicated to DevAcademy for the upcoming 4 months.</p>
